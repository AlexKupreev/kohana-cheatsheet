*Requirements*

1. PHP framework Kohana 3.0.6+
2. Kohana Userguide Module activated.

---

*Installation*

1. Unpack module folder in Kohana_PATH/modules/ dir.
2. Add to file Kohana_PATH/application/bootstrap.php into array parameter of Kohana::modules() entry 
	'cheatsheet' => MODPATH.'cheatsheet',

---

*Usage*

Browse http://example.com/cs

Click on a property/method name to see its parameters and description (if they exist). Click one more time to hide block. Or click on "close" button inside the description block to close it.

You can resize page to change text size and number of columns in the browser window. 

You can manually invalidate cache by clicking "Invalidate cache" link at the bottom of the page.

You can set in module config (Kohana_PATH/modules/cheatsheet/config/cs.php):
1. some classes that should not be included in the sheet (you can use masks with asterisk). In the current version you can set precise class name to ignore (e.g., 'kohana_log') or use following mask types:
   + beginning of the class name (e.g. 'someword\*' will exclude from the sheet 'someword_about_love')
   + ending of the class name (e.g. '\*someword' will exclude from the sheet 'tell_me_someword')
   + occurrence in the class name (e.g. '\*someword\*' will exclude from the sheet 'tell_me_someword_about_love') 
2. should cache be turned on (TRUE or FALSE) -- I recommend set to TRUE, cache is on real data, not expiration time

*Notes*

In the current version module does not support i18n â€” works only in English.
